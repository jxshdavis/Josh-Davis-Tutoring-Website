      <Content>
        I am a Senior at Rice University studying mathematics and statistics. Iâ€™ve been independently tutoring math and science for the past 4 years.
        I believe that tackling new problems and asking questions are the best
        ways to learn. My goal is to teach all my students how to think
        creatively and analytically.{" "}
