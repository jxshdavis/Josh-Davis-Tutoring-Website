        I am a Junior at Rice University studying mathematics and computer
        science. Iâ€™ve been independently tutoring math and science for 3 years.
        I believe that tackling new problems and asking questions are the best
        ways to learn. My goal is to teach all my students how to think
        creatively.{" "}
